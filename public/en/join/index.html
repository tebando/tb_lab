          <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The information environment surrounding school sites continues to change greatly, including the use of one GIGA device per student, the use of educational data, and elementary school programming education. From now on, not only information specialists but each of us is required to acquire basic literacy related to information and to engage in problem solving while appropriately using data and ICT. In particular, enhancing information education in elementary and secondary education is an important issue in fostering the qualities and abilities needed for everyone to use information and information technology appropriately and live richly.</p>
<p>Advances in information and information technology are fast, and it is not enough to simply be able to use a specific tool. It is important to foster a perspective for determining &ldquo;what to use, why, and how&rdquo; according to the situation, and to design classes and learning activities in ways that lead to learners&rsquo; understanding and growth. It is fine even if you are not good at computer operation. Together with children and students, teachers also enjoy trial and error and connect it to meaningful learning activities. That process itself becomes a clue for deepening educational data utilization and learning design.</p>
<p><strong>First, please check the research themes and contact us through the inquiry form.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="research-themes-educational-data-utilization-and-learning-design">Research Themes (Educational Data Utilization and Learning Design)</h2>
<p>In this laboratory, we mainly promote research and practical development from the following perspectives.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Educational research on AI/ICT utilization based on individual characteristics of children and students</strong><br>
Using clues such as learning status, interests, and characteristics of stumbling points, we explore support and learning environment design suitable for each learner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Educational research on cross-curricular problem-solving learning with technology as the axis</strong><br>
Beyond subject boundaries, we examine the design of learning activities in which learners discover and set problems, inquire, and express while using data and digital technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research on fostering information utilization ability</strong><br>
We handle elementary school programming education, information morality, information security, and digital citizenship, and explore the development of abilities not only to &ldquo;use&rdquo; but also to &ldquo;judge and utilize.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Research on educational improvement using educational data</strong><br>
Using class and learning records, learning outcomes, and data related to school management as clues, we examine methods that lead to class improvement, learning support, and school improvement.</p>

<h2 id="for-those-who-wish-to-enter-a-doctoral-program">For Those Who Wish to Enter a Doctoral Program</h2>
<p>Entering a doctoral program is not merely an extension of learning, but a major step as a researcher. It is by no means an easy path, but what you gain is also large.</p>
<p>An important point is that obtaining a doctoral degree alone does not immediately make one a university faculty member. Calls for applications that assume a doctoral degree are increasing, but <strong>research achievements as an expert in the field (especially peer-reviewed papers)</strong> are extremely important.</p>
<p>In a doctoral program, you are asked, &ldquo;What can you discover, and how can you contribute to the world?&rdquo; Rather than proceeding as an extension up to the master&rsquo;s level, the core is to set a <strong>meaningful original question</strong> and seek its answer.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-a-laboratory-for-a-doctoral-program-important-points">Choosing a Laboratory for a Doctoral Program: Important Points</h2>
<h3 id="1-whether-the-research-content-is-truly-of-interest">1. Whether the research content is truly of interest</h3>
<p>In a doctoral program, you work on one research theme for three years (or more, depending on the case). Therefore, whether you can think &ldquo;I want to master this field&rdquo; is extremely important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the latest papers and reviews in the desired research field</li>
<li>Participate in academic societies and study groups in the desired research field (presentation if possible)</li>
<li>Check recent achievements of the laboratory (papers, presentations, projects)</li>
<li>Check where the research themes of the laboratory and faculty are &ldquo;currently&rdquo; located (past and present may differ)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-compatibility-with-the-supervisor">2. Compatibility with the supervisor</h3>
<p>In a doctoral program, the relationship with the supervisor becomes very important.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervision style (strict guidance / respect for autonomy, etc.)</li>
<li>Research progression method (meeting frequency, method of progress confirmation)</li>
<li>Support policy for paper writing and conference presentations</li>
<li>Laboratory visits (online interviews), seminar participation, and checking student feedback</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-support-for-research-funds-and-finances">3. Support for research funds and finances</h3>
<p>To continue research, support such as scholarships and RA (research assistant) is also important. Check the support system of the graduate school and university in advance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
<p><strong>First, please check the research themes and contact us through the inquiry form.</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to conduct research as a student, adding the following will make the process up to the interview smoother.</p>
<ul>
<li>Preferred category (Master&rsquo;s / Doctoral / Research Student)</li>
<li>Theme of interest (keywords acceptable)</li>
<li>Preferred timing (from around when)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are considering collaborative research, please briefly fill in the background of the issue and the expected data (availability and type).</p>
